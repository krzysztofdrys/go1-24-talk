# What is new in Go

# Opinionated list

<div></div>

The most interesting features in the last two releases.

Not always the most useful.

Starting with the most interesting ones, so I can finish at any time.

---

There was a time when Go was considered an almost complete language.

# Numer one: maps

To quote the release notes:

> Several performance improvements to the runtime have decreased CPU overheads by 2‚Äì3% on average across a suite of representative benchmarks. Results may vary by application. These improvements include a new builtin map implementation based on Swiss Tables, more efficient memory allocation of small objects, and a new runtime-internal mutex implementation.

--- 

# Why is this exciting?

1. We get a performance boost for free.
2. It is interesting that hash maps is something that can be improved.
3. It's a bold step for Go developers to change the implementation of something as fundamental to the language as a map.

# Hash maps

When I was a student, hash maps seemed like a solved problem to me: [^1].

# Swiss tables

1. I have no idea why they are called like that.
2. Created at Google in 2017,
3. Implemented as an open-source project c++ library in 2018,
4. Implemented as Go libraries by a few people (https://github.com/cockroachdb/swiss, https://github.com/dolthub/swiss)
5. Now used as `map` "backend" in Go 1.24.


---

# Money for nothing

1. A lot of apps I worked on, spent most of their time marshalling/unmarshalling JSON, so I don't know if they would be affected ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
2. I imagine that 1% performance boost means big savings for Google and other big companies üí∞
3. Let's see if we can replicate this.

# Benchmarks!


---

# Benchmark 1: append
Create a map and keep adding to it.

```go
m := make(map[int]struct{}, 0)
for j := 0; j < size; j++ {
    m[j] = struct{}{}
}
```

---

# Benchmark 2: insert 
Create a map with a predefined size and keep adding to it. Hopefully

```go
b.StopTimer()
m := make(map[int]struct{}, 2*size)
b.StartTimer()
for j := 0; j < size; j++ {
    m[j] = struct{}{}
}
```

---

# Benchmark 3: get
Create a map with a predefined size and keep adding to it. Hopefully

```go
b.StopTimer()
m := make(map[int]struct{}, 2*size)
for j := 0; j < size; j++ {
    m[j] = struct{}{}
}
b.StartTimer()

for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
    _, ok := m[i%(2*size)]
    if ok {
        sink++
    }
}
```

---

# Benchmark 4: delete
Create a map with a predefined size and keep adding to it. Hopefully

```go
b.StopTimer()
m := make(map[int]struct{}, 2*size)
for j := 0; j < size; j++ {
    m[j] = struct{}{}
}
b.StartTimer()
for j := 0; j < size; j++ {
    delete(m, j)
}
```

```ts {all|2|1-6|9|all}
interface User {
  id: number
  firstName: string
  lastName: string

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.
